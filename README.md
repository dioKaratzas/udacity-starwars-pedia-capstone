## How to Work with the Source

* In order to get Crashlytics to work, you need to put your Fabric secret key on the AndroidManifest.xml file 
```AndroidManifest.xml
<meta-data
    android:name="io.fabric.ApiKey"
    android:value="your api key" />
```


* Firebase Storage is used to store and retrieve the StarWars data images since the API doesn‚Äôt provide image resources.
You must add your Firebase google-services.json file into the app/ folder.
